Plastikit Project
=================

Overview
--------
Plastikit is an innovative project designed to transform recycled plastic bottles into functional 3D printed products. The project combines both hardware and software components to create a comprehensive recycling and 3D printing system, particularly focused on educational outreach and environmental sustainability.

Installation Instructions
--------------------------

Prerequisites
-------------
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Hardware Components:
  - ESP32 Microcontroller
  - HX711 Load Cell
  - 1602 LCD Display with I2C
  - W1209 Temperature Controller
  - 24V DC Gear Motor
  - V6 Volcano Hot End
  - MOSFETs for controlling heating elements and motors
  - Power Supply (24V)

- Software Requirements:
  - Arduino IDE or PlatformIO for programming the ESP32
  - Next.js for the web-based dashboard
  - Node.js and npm for backend services
  - Vercel for deployment of the web interface
  - Git for version control

Step-by-Step Installation
--------------------------
1. Hardware Setup:
   - Assemble the Plastikit machine according to the hardware architecture diagram.
   - Connect the ESP32 microcontroller to the sensors, LCD, and other components.
   - Ensure the MOSFETs are properly connected to control the heating elements and motors.
   - Power the system using a 24V power supply.

2. Software Setup:
   - Clone the repositories from the provided GitHub link: https://github.com/weizmanroy/PlasikitFinal.git.
   - Navigate to the `web-dashboard` directory and install dependencies:
     ```
     cd web-dashboard
     npm install
     ```
   - Deploy the dashboard on Vercel using the following command:
     ```
     vercel --prod
     ```
   - Program the ESP32 microcontroller using Arduino IDE or PlatformIO:
     - Open the ESP32 project in your IDE.
     - Upload the code to the ESP32 via USB connection.

3. Starting the System:
   - Power on the Plastikit machine.
   - Access the web dashboard via the URL [https://www.plastikit.online].
